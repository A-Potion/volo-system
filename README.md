# volo-system
I'm doing this project because I was volunteering at cultural events in my hometown, and the volunteer coordinators spent a lot of time just copying data between Google Sheets and Forms. They made mistakes, and wasted time that could otherwise have been used for supporting volunteers and the event. I want to give them the time to make cultural in my town better.


A (future) all-in-one platform for:
- Volunteer sign-up
- Communication with volunteers
- Scheduling volunteers (while receiving their preferences)

### Experience it at https://volo-system.wacper.hackclub.app

## Current features deployed:

- Sign in with a magic email link.
- Create an event with a name & a date.
- Event deletion.
- Get a unique link to volunteer form (hardcoded form for now).
- Fill out the form.
- Event owner view of signed-up volunteers.
- You also can delete the event.

## WIP features:
- Export volunteer list to CSV.

## AI usage

ChatGPT & Copilot were used for debugging exclusively. Less than 30% of the code, hence not mentioned in project page.
